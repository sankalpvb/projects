Q3. 
Software Development Process Model Report
Selected Process Model: Agile Development Model
Overview
The Agile Development Model is a flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of functional software. This model is particularly suitable for projects where requirements may evolve, such as in the development of a Travel Management System.

Key Features
Iterative Development: Work is divided into small, manageable units called sprints (typically 2-4 weeks), allowing for regular reassessment and adaptation of plans.
Customer Collaboration: Regular meetings with stakeholders ensure that the product meets user needs and expectations.
Continuous Improvement: Teams reflect on their performance after each sprint and make adjustments for future iterations.
Advantages
Flexibility: Accommodates changes in requirements even late in the development process.
Faster Time to Market: Prioritizes delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly.
Enhanced Quality: Regular testing and feedback cycles help identify and resolve issues early.
Disadvantages
Less Predictability: Time and cost estimates can be challenging to maintain due to the iterative nature.
Requires Strong Collaboration: Success depends on effective communication and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.
Conclusion
The Agile Development Model is ideal for the Travel Management System project due to its adaptability to changing requirements and focus on user feedback. This approach will enable the team to deliver a high-quality product that aligns closely with user needs.
